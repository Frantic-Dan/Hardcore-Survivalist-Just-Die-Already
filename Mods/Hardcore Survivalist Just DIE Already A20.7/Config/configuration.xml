                       <Description>An overhaul vanilla mod for veteran players who find pure vanilla too easy and are seeking a challenge with the vanilla feel. This overhaul mod adds back the survival that is lacking in the game.


			Recommended settings:
			Warrior, Run during the day, No loot respawn, 24 blood moon count, Airdrops weekly.

			- Incurable Infection. Dying from infection is gameover!
			- More wild zombie spawns.
			- Slower progression to extend the live of a world to 100+ days.
			- Farming is nerfed so the struggle for food extends to mid game.
			- Less ammo, food and quantity in loot, less resources when mining and harvesting ores/blocks.
			- Economy rebalanced so you won't be swimming in dukes as easily and have to make thoughtful decisions when buying.
			- A Single Player version of the Charismatic Nature perk. (Survival Instinct)
			- Dying has a harsher consequence, retaining debuffs and hunger, etc.
			- An optional 'Master Mode' that turns all normal zombies into ferlas, and ferals into radiateds!
